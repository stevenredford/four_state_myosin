# four_state_myosin
This project simulates a myosin motor such as those in Schindler et. al. Nat. Nano. 2014 walking along an implicit actin filament. The simulation relies on the
Gillespie algorithm and computes steps based on the occupancy of various states. The publication describing the model is in progress. The basic model is presented
in four_state_model.ipynb. The phase space of interest for the publication is calculated in four_state_model_big.ipynb. four_state_control.ipynb plots some useful
controls corresponding to the experiments preformed in Schindler.
